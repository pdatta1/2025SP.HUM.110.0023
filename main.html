    <p>Exploring the Evolution and Ethical Implications of Key Technologies</p>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project delves into the historical evolution and the social, ethical, and economic implications of modern technologies such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles. The analysis draws upon historical developments and recent advancements to provide a comprehensive view of the role of technology in shaping our society.</p>
</section>

<section class="content">
    <h2>Technoscience and the Biotech Industry</h2>
    <h3>Biotechnology: An Overview</h3>
    <p>Biotechnology refers to the manipulation of living organisms or their parts to create products that are useful to humans. This has led to the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), synthetic insulin, probiotics, and biodegradable plastics. The rise of biotechnology in recent decades has been propelled by significant breakthroughs in genetic engineering, particularly recombinant DNA (rDNA) technologies.</p>
    <p>Stanford University, led by Paul Berg in 1971, made significant progress by splicing the DNA of two viruses, marking a pivotal moment in the history of biotechnology. This research raised ethical concerns, particularly around genetic modification and the potential creation of genetically altered organisms.</p>
    
    <h3>Ethical Considerations in Biotechnology</h3>
    <p>As biotechnology has advanced, several ethical issues have arisen, such as the risks of cloning, genetic modification, and the use of synthetic biology. Technologies like gene-editing and cloning have opened the door to both positive innovations and unintended consequences. For instance, the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 brought attention to the ethical implications of cloning animals, particularly regarding animal welfare and genetic diversity.</p>

<section class="timeline">
    <h2>Historical Timeline: The Evolution of Technoscience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing asks, "Can machines think?" laying the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
        <li><strong>1971:</strong> Paul Berg at Stanford University splices DNA, a major milestone in biotechnology.</li>
        <li><strong>1996:</strong> Dolly the sheep becomes the first cloned mammal, sparking global debates on the ethics of cloning.</li>
        <li><strong>1997:</strong> Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov, showcasing AI's potential in strategic thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>2011:</strong> IBM's Watson wins the Jeopardy challenge, marking a major breakthrough in natural language processing.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="ethical-considerations">
    <h2>Ethical and Social Implications of Emerging Technologies</h2>
    <p>Emerging technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, and biotechnologies raise important ethical questions about their use and regulation. Some key concerns include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Should self-driving cars be programmed to prioritize the safety of their passengers over other road users? In case of an accident, should liability lie with the manufacturer or the car owner?</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> What role should AI play in decision-making, and how can we ensure its development benefits society without causing harm, such as bias or discrimination?</li>
        <li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong> With advances in gene editing, there is the question of whether humans should have the right to alter the genetic makeup of organisms, including humans.</li>
    </ul>
